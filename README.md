# garcia5 dotfiles

My own personal configurations, install any of them using the provided `setup.sh` script

```
setup.sh [bash, brew, nvim, tmux, zsh, ALL]
```

Symlinks the associated configuration file to the one in this repo and creates a copy of the original

## TODO
- `g` commands
- add strictly necessary packages to brew-installed
  - fzf
  - ripgrep
  - neovim --HEAD
  - bat
  - python3
  - npm
  - tree-sitter
  - zsh

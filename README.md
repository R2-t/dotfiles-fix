# garcia5 dotfiles

My own personal configurations, install any of them using the provided `setup.sh` script

```
setup.sh [bash, brew, nvim, tmux, zsh, alacritty, install_packages, ALL]
```

Symlinks the associated configuration file to the one in this repo and creates a copy of the original

TODO:

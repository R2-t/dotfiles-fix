# garcia5 dotfiles

My own personal configurations, install any of them using the provided `setup.sh` script

```
setup.sh [bash, brew, nvim, tmux, zsh, ALL]
```

Symlinks the associated configuration file to the one in this repo and creates a copy of the original

TODO:
- Make sure required base packages are installed somehow
  - requires figuring out what required base packages _are_
- **Use `g` commands more**
- See if there's any way to force `formatopts` for all filetypes
- Update .zshrc to have parity with .bashrc
